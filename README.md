# Classic ML Algorithms

A collection of classic machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch in Python, with interactive Jupyter notebooks for hands-on learning and visualization.

## Contents

- **Linear Regression**: Gradient descent-based linear regression on synthetic data, with visualization and evaluation metrics.
- **Logistic Regression**: Binary classification using logistic regression and gradient descent, including decision boundary visualization.
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Custom decision tree classifier for non-linear data, with accuracy and confusion matrix evaluation.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
	```sh
	git clone <your-repo-url>
	cd Classic-ML-Algorithms
	```
2. **Install requirements**
	- Recommended: Use a virtual environment (e.g., `venv` or `conda`).
	- Install dependencies:
	  ```sh
	  pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
	  ```
3. **Run the notebooks**
	- Open any `.ipynb` file (e.g., `Linear Regression.ipynb`) in Jupyter or VS Code.
	- Run cells sequentially to see code, explanations, and visualizations.

## Project Structure

- `Linear Regression.ipynb` — Linear regression from scratch
- `Logistic Regression.ipynb` — Logistic regression from scratch
- `Decision Tree Classifier.ipynb` — Decision tree classifier from scratch
- `README.md` — Project overview and instructions

## Notes
- All algorithms are implemented without using high-level ML libraries (e.g., no scikit-learn models for core logic).
- Each notebook is self-contained and includes explanations before each code cell for clarity.
